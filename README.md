This repo is published to kentonv.github.io.

I don't actually publish a site there. The problem is, when a repository is
transferred to a new owner (or organization), everything is redirected
*except* github pages, which instead get locked in time and may eventually
404 (unclear).

So I created a user-level page containing a capnproto subdirectory with
HTML meta redirects in order to redirect the site.

Lesson learned: Don't host anything important on github pages. :/
